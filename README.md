# SPAC Analysis Program

## Introduction: 
Following program is to help identify trends among SPACs prior to their closing/liquidation date. 

## Program:
Program can be run from the command line, or from notebook.  For visualizations, it is recommended that it be run from notebook.

## Requirements:
Libraries: 
Program does not require any libraries beyond what is included in the standard conda download

## Output:
Output is a table containing the various deltas between the date of max price and the ipo, record, press release, and closing date. SPAC price at each of these dates has also been recorded to calculate various growth / decline from announcement to max date. 

## Next Steps:
There are a series of next steps that can be implemented in the analyses:
1. Grouping based on industry
2. Standard deviation / mean of deltas at various date
3. Predictive element of upcoming SPACs
